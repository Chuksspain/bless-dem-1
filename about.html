        The Oxford English Dictionary defines wisdom as "Capacity of judging rightly in matters relating to life and
        conduct; soundness of judgment in the choice of means and ends; sometimes, less strictly, sound sense, esp. in
        practical affairs: opp. to folly;" also "Knowledge (esp. of a high or abstruse kind); enlightenment, learning,
        erudition."[8] Charles Haddon Spurgeon defined wisdom as "the right use of knowledge".[9] Robert I. Sutton and
        Andrew Hargadon defined the "attitude of wisdom" as "acting with knowledge while doubting what one knows". In
        social and psychological sciences, several distinct approaches to wisdom exist,[3] with major advances made in
        the last two decades with respect to operationalization[2] and measurement[7] of wisdom as a psychological
        construct. Wisdom is the capacity to have foreknowledge of something, to know the consequences (both positive
        and negative) of all the available course of actions, and to yield or take the options with the most advantage
        either for present or future implication.[10]

        Mythological and philosophical perspectives
        The ancient Greeks considered wisdom to be an important virtue, personified as the goddesses Metis and Athena.
        Metis was the first wife of Zeus, who, according to Hesiod's Theogony, had devoured her pregnant; Zeus earned
        the title of Mêtieta ("The Wise Counselor") after that, as Metis was the embodiment of wisdom, and he gave birth
        to Athena, who is said to have sprung from his head.[11][12] Athena was portrayed as strong, fair, merciful, and
        chaste.[13] Apollo was also considered a god of wisdom, designated as the conductor of the Muses
        (Musagetes),[14] who were personifications of the sciences and of the inspired and poetic arts; According to
        Plato in his Cratylus, the name of Apollo could also mean "Ballon" (archer) and "Omopoulon" (unifier of poles
        [divine and earthly]), since this god was responsible for divine and true inspirations, thus considered an
        archer who was always right in healing and oracles: "he is an ever-darting archer".[15] Apollo was considered
        the god who prophesied through the priestesses (Pythia) in the Temple of Apollo (Delphi), where the aphorism
        "know thyself" (gnōthi seauton)[a] was inscribed (part of the wisdom of the Delphic maxims).[16] He was
        contrasted with Hermes, who was related to the sciences and technical wisdom, and, in the first centuries after
        Christ, was associated with Thoth in an Egyptian syncretism, under the name Hermes Trimegistus.[17] Greek
        tradition recorded the earliest introducers of wisdom in the Seven Sages of Greece.[18]

        To Socrates and Plato, philosophy was literally the love of wisdom (philo-sophia). This permeates Plato's
        dialogue; in The Republic the leaders of his proposed utopia are philosopher kings who understand the Form of
        the Good and possess the courage to act accordingly. Aristotle, in Metaphysics, defined wisdom as understanding
        why things are a certain way (causality), which is deeper than merely knowing things are a certain way.[19] He
        was the first to make the distinction between phronesis and sophia.[5]

        According to Plato and Xenophon, the Pythia of the Delphic Oracle answered the question "who is the wisest man
        in Greece?" by stating Socrates was the wisest.[20][21] According to Plato's Apology, Socrates decided to
        investigate the people who might be considered wiser than him, concluding they lacked true knowledge:

        […] οὗτος μὲν οἴεταί τι εἰδέναι οὐκ εἰδώς, ἐγὼ δέ, ὥσπερ οὖν οὐκ οἶδα, οὐδὲ οἴομαι [I am wiser than this man;
        for neither of us really knows anything fine and good, but this man thinks he knows something when he does not,
        whereas I, as I do not know anything, do not think I do either.]

        — Apology to Socrates 21d
        Thus it became popularly immortalized in the phrase "I know that I know nothing" that it is wise to recognize
        one's own ignorance[22] and to value epistemic humility.[23]

        The ancient Romans also valued wisdom which was personified in Minerva, or Pallas. She also represents skillful
        knowledge and the virtues, especially chastity. Her symbol was the owl which is still a popular representation
        of wisdom, because it can see in darkness. She was said to be born from Jupiter's forehead.[24]

        Wisdom is also important within Christianity. Jesus emphasized it.[25][26] Paul the Apostle, in his first
        epistle to the Corinthians, argued that there is both secular and divine wisdom, urging Christians to pursue the
        latter. Prudence, which is intimately related to wisdom, became one of the four cardinal virtues of Catholicism.
        The Christian philosopher Thomas Aquinas considered wisdom to be the "father" (i.e. the cause, measure, and
        form) of all virtues.

        In Buddhist traditions, developing wisdom plays a central role where comprehensive guidance on how to develop
        wisdom is provided.[27][28] In the Inuit tradition, developing wisdom was one of the aims of teaching. An Inuit
        Elder said that a person became wise when they could see what needed to be done and did it successfully without
        being told what to do.

        In many cultures, the name for third molars, which are the last teeth to grow, is etymologically linked with
        wisdom, e.g., as in the English wisdom tooth. It has its nickname originated from the classical tradition, which
        in the Hippocratic writings has already been called sóphronistér (in Greek, related to the meaning of moderation
        or teaching a lesson), and in Latin dens sapientiae (wisdom tooth), since they appear at the age of maturity in
        late adolescence and early adulthood.[29]
