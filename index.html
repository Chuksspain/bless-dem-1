            The Oxford English Dictionary defines wisdom as "Capacity of judging rightly in matters relating to life and
            conduct; soundness of judgment in the choice of means and ends; sometimes, less strictly, sound sense, esp.
            in
            practical affairs: opp. to folly;" also "Knowledge (esp. of a high or abstruse kind); enlightenment,
            learning,
            erudition."[8] Charles Haddon Spurgeon defined wisdom as "the right use of knowledge".[9] Robert I. Sutton
            and
            Andrew Hargadon defined the "attitude of wisdom" as "acting with knowledge while doubting what one knows".
            In
            social and psychological sciences, several distinct approaches to wisdom exist,[3] with major advances made
            in
            the last two decades with respect to operationalization[2] and measurement[7] of wisdom as a psychological
            construct. Wisdom is the capacity to have foreknowledge of something, to know the consequences (both
            positive
            and negative) of all the available course of actions, and to yield or take the options with the most
            advantage
            either for present or future implication.[10]

            Mythological and philosophical perspectives
            The ancient Greeks considered wisdom to be an important virtue, personified as the goddesses Metis and
            Athena.
            Metis was the first wife of Zeus, who, according to Hesiod's Theogony, had devoured her pregnant; Zeus
            earned
            the title of Mêtieta ("The Wise Counselor") after that, as Metis was the embodiment of wisdom, and he gave
            birth
            to Athena, who is said to have sprung from his head.[11][12] Athena was portrayed as strong, fair, merciful,
            and
            chaste.[13] Apollo was also considered a god of wisdom, designated as the conductor of the Muses
            (Musagetes),[14] who were personifications of the sciences and of the inspired and poetic arts; According to
            Plato in his Cratylus, the name of Apollo could also mean "Ballon" (archer) and "Omopoulon" (unifier of
            poles
            [divine and earthly]), since this god was responsible for divine and true inspirations, thus considered an
            archer who was always right in healing and oracles: "he is an ever-darting archer".[15] Apollo was
            considered
            the god who prophesied through the priestesses (Pythia) in the Temple of Apollo (Delphi), where the aphorism
            "know thyself" (gnōthi seauton)[a] was inscribed (part of the wisdom of the Delphic maxims).[16] He was
            contrasted with Hermes, who was related to the sciences and technical wisdom, and, in the first centuries
            after
            Christ, was associated with Thoth in an Egyptian syncretism, under the name Hermes Trimegistus.[17] Greek
            tradition recorded the earliest introducers of wisdom in the Seven Sages of Greece.[18]

            To Socrates and Plato, philosophy was literally the love of wisdom (philo-sophia). This permeates Plato's
            dialogue; in The Republic the leaders of his proposed utopia are philosopher kings who understand the Form
            of
            the Good and possess the courage to act accordingly. Aristotle, in Metaphysics, defined wisdom as
            understanding
            why things are a certain way (causality), which is deeper than merely knowing things are a certain way.[19]
            He
            was the first to make the distinction between phronesis and sophia.[5]

            According to Plato and Xenophon, the Pythia of the Delphic Oracle answered the question "who is the wisest
            man
            in Greece?" by stating Socrates was the wisest.[20][21] According to Plato's Apology, Socrates decided to
            investigate the people who might be considered wiser than him, concluding they lacked true knowledge:

            […] οὗτος μὲν οἴεταί τι εἰδέναι οὐκ εἰδώς, ἐγὼ δέ, ὥσπερ οὖν οὐκ οἶδα, οὐδὲ οἴομαι [I am wiser than this
            man;
            for neither of us really knows anything fine and good, but this man thinks he knows something when he does
            not,
            whereas I, as I do not know anything, do not think I do either.]

            — Apology to Socrates 21d
            Thus it became popularly immortalized in the phrase "I know that I know nothing" that it is wise to
            recognize
            one's own ignorance[22] and to value epistemic humility.[23]

            The ancient Romans also valued wisdom which was personified in Minerva, or Pallas. She also represents
            skillful
            knowledge and the virtues, especially chastity. Her symbol was the owl which is still a popular
            representation
            of wisdom, because it can see in darkness. She was said to be born from Jupiter's forehead.[24]

            Wisdom is also important within Christianity. Jesus emphasized it.[25][26] Paul the Apostle, in his first
            epistle to the Corinthians, argued that there is both secular and divine wisdom, urging Christians to pursue
            the
            latter. Prudence, which is intimately related to wisdom, became one of the four cardinal virtues of
            Catholicism.
            The Christian philosopher Thomas Aquinas considered wisdom to be the "father" (i.e. the cause, measure, and
            form) of all virtues.

            In Buddhist traditions, developing wisdom plays a central role where comprehensive guidance on how to
            develop
            wisdom is provided.[27][28] In the Inuit tradition, developing wisdom was one of the aims of teaching. An
            Inuit
            Elder said that a person became wise when they could see what needed to be done and did it successfully
            without
            being told what to do.

            In many cultures, the name for third molars, which are the last teeth to grow, is etymologically linked with
            wisdom, e.g., as in the English wisdom tooth. It has its nickname originated from the classical tradition,
            which
            in the Hippocratic writings has already been called sóphronistér (in Greek, related to the meaning of
            moderation
            or teaching a lesson), and in Latin dens sapientiae (wisdom tooth), since they appear at the age of maturity
            in
            late adolescence and early adulthood.[29]

        conduct; soundness of judgment in the choice of means and ends; sometimes, less strictly, sound sense, esp. in
